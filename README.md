Title: Assessing Dense Forest Distribution in Nigerian States: A Geospatial Analysis Using Remote Sensing Data

Abstract:<br>
This study employs remote sensing data from the FAO GAUL: Global Administrative Unit Layers 2015, First-Level Administrative Units, and the JAXA EORC Global 4-class PALSAR-2/PALSAR Forest/Non-Forest Map for the year 2020, accessed through Google Earth Engine, to evaluate dense forest distribution across states in Nigeria. Leveraging the GEEMAP Python API, the analysis focused on the South East, South South, and North Eastern regions. Results indicate that while Taraba state in North Eastern Nigeria and Cross River state in the South South exhibit the largest land areas covered with dense forest, Taraba's dense forest cover accounts for less than 18% of its total land area, highlighting the importance of considering landmass in forest cover assessments. Cross River, conversely, boasts the highest percentage of dense forest cover relative to its landmass, underscoring the need for targeted conservation efforts. Only three states, Cross River, Bayelsa, and Osun state have above 20% of their landmass covered by dense forest, while 10 states have over 10% and 11 states have less than 1%. Utilizing QGIS, cartographic maps were created, and bar graphs and pie charts were generated to visually depict variations in forest cover among states.

Introduction:<br>
Understanding the spatial distribution of dense forests is critical for effective conservation and land management strategies. This research leverages remote sensing technology and geographic information system (GIS) tools to assess dense forest distribution across Nigerian states. By integrating data from the FAO GAUL and JAXA EORC, this study provides insights into the extent and variability of dense forest cover in different regions of Nigeria.

Methodology:<br>
The study utilizes remote sensing data accessed through Google Earth Engine, focusing on the FAO GAUL and JAXA EORC datasets. Utilizing the GEEMAP Python API, the analysis zooms in on the South East, South South, and North Eastern regions of Nigeria. The percentage of dense forest cover relative to total land area is calculated for each state, with particular attention paid to states with significant forest cover. Cartographic maps are created using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS), and graphical representations such as bar graphs and pie charts are generated to visually illustrate variations in forest cover among states.

Results:<br>
The analysis reveals that Taraba state in North Eastern Nigeria and Cross River state in the South South exhibit the largest land areas covered with dense forest. However, Taraba's dense forest cover constitutes less than 18% of its total land area, emphasizing the need to consider landmass in forest cover assessments. Cross River, in contrast, boasts the highest percentage of dense forest cover relative to its landmass, highlighting its ecological significance. Only three states, Cross River, Bayelsa, and Osun state have above 20% of their landmass covered by dense forest, underscoring the importance of targeted conservation efforts.

Conclusion:<br>
This research contributes to our understanding of dense forest distribution in Nigerian states and provides valuable insights for conservation planning and policy formulation. By leveraging remote sensing data and GIS techniques, the study identifies regions with significant forest cover and underscores the need for tailored conservation strategies. The visualization of results through cartographic maps and graphical representations enhances the accessibility and communicative impact of the findings, facilitating informed decision-making in forest management and conservation efforts in Nigeria.
