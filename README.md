Using the GEEMAP Python API for Google Earth Engine to Assess Dense Forest Distribution in Nigerian States: A Geospatial Analysis Using Remote Sensing Data

To map forests on a regional and global scale consistently and effectively satellite observatory remote sensing is required. A range of uses is made possible by maps of forest cover created from satellite data, which describe forests at particular times. Forests provide essential terrestrial ecosystem services and are associated with the highest species richness and variety among ecosystems, despite being overexploited.


The spatial distribution of forest cover in Nigeria is assessed using the global 4-class PALSAR-2/PALSAR forest/non-forest 2020 map from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, with a focus on the forest cover of the southeast, south-south, and northeastern states. Assessing the forest cover of these states contributes to our understanding of dense forest distribution in Nigeria and provides valuable insights for conservation planning and policy formulation.


The [GEEMAP Python API](analysis_script/nigeria_forest_cover_analysis_img.ipynb) is used to compute the forest cover percentage of each state's total land area. According to the data, the states with the largest forest cover are Cross River in the South and Taraba in Northeastern Nigeria. However, forest cover occupies less than 18% of Taraba's land area, highlighting the significance of considering landmass when estimating forest cover.


Only three Nigerian states have more than 20% forest cover, underlining the urgency of targeted conservation efforts in the remaining states to meet the FAO's recommended forest cover threshold.
