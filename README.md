The analysis reveals that Taraba state in North Eastern Nigeria and Cross River state in the South-South exhibit the largest land areas covered with dense forest. However, Taraba's dense forest cover constitutes less than 18% of its total land area, emphasizing the need to consider landmass in forest cover assessments. Cross River, in contrast, boasts the highest percentage of dense forest cover relative to its landmass, highlighting its ecological significance. Only three states, Cross River, Bayelsa, and Osun state have more than 20% of their landmass covered by dense forest, underscoring the importance of targeted conservation efforts in these states.

Conclusion:<br>
This research contributes to our understanding of dense forest distribution in Nigerian states and provides valuable insights for conservation planning and policy formulation. By leveraging remote sensing data and GIS techniques, the study identifies regions with significant forest cover and underscores the need for tailored conservation strategies. Visualization of results through cartographic maps and graphical representations improves the accessibility and communicative impact of the findings, facilitating informed decision-making in forest management and conservation efforts in Nigeria.
