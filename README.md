# Nigeria_Forest_Density_Analysis
A Pet project, Analyzing Density of Forest Cover in Nigeria.

The project make use of the JAXA EORC Global 4-class PALSAR-2/PALSAR Forest/Non-Forest Map to assess dense forest distribution in Nigeria. Sub-Analyses was focused on SouthEast, SouthSouth, and North East Nigeria. result from the the analyses shows that Taraba state in North eastern Nigeria and Cross River state in south south Nigeria have the largest land areas covered with dense forest.

The resulting image from the southeast, south-south dense forest cover analysis was downloaded from google earth engine, converted to vector data, and used to create a cartographic map using QGIS.
